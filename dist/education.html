          <p>
            As part of the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program at UF, I have
            been paired with a research mentor named Kyle Fohrman, who happens
            to also be a Computer Science major. Besides Kyle, i have also
            received a lot of help from one of the student leaders in my
            Professional Development class, Joseph Meert, who has provided me
            with many resources of information for ongoing research at UF and
            how to become a part of that research. As part of an assignment for
            my Research & Creativity class, I was tasked with compiling a list
            of ten faculty members that I would like to do research with. This
            assignment opened my eyes to all of the opportunities I have as a
            student at UF and has inspired me to get more involved, both in
            research and the many clubs that this school has to offer

          <h3>Research Interests</h3>
          <hr />
          <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
          <li>
            Developing computer systems able to perform tasks that normally
            require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
            recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages
          </li>
          <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
          <li>
            Applying artificial intelligence to provide systems the ability to
            automatically learn and improve from experience without being
            explicitly programmed
