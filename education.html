          <p>
            I am currently studying Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Mathematics. Many of my classes focus on AI and Machine Learning fundamentals as these are topics I am interested in. Many of the classes I have taken have culminated in a group project, usually consisting of designing and developing a web app.
            It is through these classes and personal projects that I have gained many of the developing skills that I currently possess. 
          </p>

            During Summer 2021, I was afforded the opportunity to do research as a part of the Engaging Learning Lab at the University of Florida under the direction of Dr. Christina Gardner-McCune. 
            During my time working with her and the team, I developed AI and machine learning curriculum for a high school level summer camp in Orlando as well as designed activities and content directed towards students with little exposure to programming or computer science topics.

          <li>
            Developing computer systems able to perform tasks that normally
            require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
            recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages
          </li>
          <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
          <li>
            Applying artificial intelligence to provide systems the ability to
            automatically learn and improve from experience without being
            explicitly programmed
