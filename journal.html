          <p>
            When I first heard about the e-portfolio assignment that was
            required by the URSP program, I was intimidated, I didn't know what
            to do, where to start. As a computer science student, however, I was
            excited. I was interested in creating my own website, something that
            I could truly call my own, a project that summarized my interests,
            my classes, and what makes me me. I immediately knew that I wouldn't
            be going the route of wixsites or weebly and knew that I had to
            create something of my own imagination, something that I could truly
            call my own. "What kind of computer science student would I be," I
            thought to myself, if I couldn't even create my own website. And so
            I did, with the help of only Youtube videos, Google searches, and
            much trial and error, I made this portfolio from the ground up.
            Comprised of elements of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and other
            components, I am proud to call this website my own, my first true
            project.
