            When I first heard about the e-portfolio assignment that was
            required by the URSP program, I was intimidated, I didn't know what
            to do, where to start. As a computer science student, however, I was
            excited. I was interested in creating my own website, something that
            I could truly call my own, a project that summarized my interests,
            my classes, and what makes me me. I immediately knew that I wouldn't
            be going the route of wixsites or weebly and knew that I had to
            create something of my own imagination, something that I could truly
            call my own. "What kind of computer science student would I be," I
            thought to myself, if I couldn't even create my own website. And so
            I did, with the help of only Youtube videos, Google searches, and
            much trial and error, I made this portfolio from the ground up.
            Comprised of elements of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and other
            components, I am proud to call this website my own, my first true
            project.

            As the first half of the semester comes and goes, I'd like to take
            this opportunity to reflect on my time so far, what I've done, what
            I wished I would have done, and what I look forward to doing in the
            coming days and weeks. Classes have been good so far, for the first
            time in as long as I can remember, I'm actually enjoying what I'm
            learning and what I'm doing, whether it be the labs and projects in
            my programming fundamentals class or the egg drop design competition
            we did for the last day of my professional development class. Coming
            into this year I had many aspirations for getting involved in clubs,
            organizations, and other activities. In reality, I've come to
            realize that it's very difficult to balance a large courseload and
            all of these extracurriculars and as a result, I've not been as
            involved as I was planning on being. This is something that I am
            hoping to improve on in the latter half of this semester. Like many
            other students, I struggle with procrastination, however I know that
            I can overcome this and become the student that I want to be.
